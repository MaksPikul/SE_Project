# Using the App

## Step 1: Logging-in / Signing-up

When you open the app for the first time, you'll be directed to the Welcome Screen where you are offered the choice of either logging-in or signing-up. 
Choose Sign-up and enter your details into the corresponding fields and select "Sign-Up". From here you'll be renavigated to the Home Screen and will remain logged in until your session needs renewing, or you choose to logout.

Following a log-out, you can log back in by selecting the Login option from the Welcome Screen and submitting your credentials in the login form. 

## Step 2: Navigating the app

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.
This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
