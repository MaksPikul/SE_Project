TERMINAL

You need to run a virtual environment so that anybody's individual dependency installations can be automatically used by other people without installation.
Therefore, if you pip install anything, please do it in the project directory :)

When opening:
python -m venv venv (activates virtual environement - make sure you are on the project directory)
python manage.py runserver (starts the server)

When done:
python -m venv venv (deactivate the environment at the end)
